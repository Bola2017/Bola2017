Input: a training set of observations, each labelled with one class label.
Output: a model (classifier) which assigns a class to each observation based on the other attributes.
The tuples (observations, samples) are partitioned in training set + test set.

Classification is performed in two steps:
training - build the model from training set
test - check accuracy of the model using test set
The model can be used to predict the class of new observations, for which the class label is missing or unknown. 
Performance Metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, specificity, F1 score etc.
